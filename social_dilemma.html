      The Social Dilemma<br /><br />
      I first watched this documentary on September 20th. The reason I remember
      it so clearly is because it was so influential and thought-provoking, that
      I instantly wrote a whole paragraph in my diary. I also went ahead and
      told all my closest friends, family about it. There were a number of
      things that stood out to me. Well, to begin, I'm a student studying
      computer science, and even before that, I just love what technology does.
      It brings people together, inspires thoughts and ideas, create
      connections, communicates, and provides. However, with all the good sides,
      there are always the bad sights behind the spotlight. And “The Social
      Dilemma” did a good job on portraying the things that many of us forget to
      think in our daily lives.<br /><br />
      There were truly many moments as the CEOs, former Managers, Developers,
      came out and spoke of their experiences, especially with SNS, that also
      resonated with me. When the former worker of Pinterest spoke about how he,
      at work, managed to do everything he could to grasp the attention of the
      public, was at home and glancing and reloading his Pinterest posts again
      and again. I had this realization with Instagram, most of all. Especially
      because Facebook was “outdated” by the time I owned a smartphone. I
      created my own Instagram account in the year 2014 and I got basically
      addicted to it by the time I became a freshman in college. After a
      semester suffering “unknowingly” in the magical mystery black hole of
      Instagram, I managed to delete my account permanently. There were truly

      When the former worker of Pinterest spoke about how he, at work, managed

      home and glancing and reloading his Pinterest posts again and again. I had

      the time I became a freshman in college. After a semester suffering
      “unknowingly” in the magical mystery black hole of Instagram, I managed to
      delete my account permanently.<br /><br />The film “The Social Dilemma”
      actually allowed me to rethink the reasons why I had deleted my account.
      The sentence, “If you’re not paying for the product, then you
      <i>are </i> the product” summed up my thoughts together. It was mind
      blowing. Instagram, as it was free to use, was gobbling up my attention,
      time, and energy altogether. It created the FOMO, fear of missing out,
      structured what I thought was good, happy, and beautiful, and made me live
      a fake life. I was envious of other people’s life which actually weren’t,
      and I was showing the best bits of life which weren’t all of me. I was
      trying my best to grab onto the so-called followers and friends that was
      nothing but numbers. I was trying to prove to people that I would never or
      maybe see once a year that I was living a great life. I even started a
      “portfolio” account hoping that people will find me and call me a person
      with a talent. Even for YouTube, the reason why it is so engaging, is
      because it knows who we are, what we want, and they make us want what they
      want. All the platforms are monetizing with our attention, time, and
      energy that we put in into the little screen of ours.<br /><br />Just as
      one person said that there are two fields in which we use the word
      “users”, and that is in the world of drugs and in the world of technology.
      This scared me. It also made me alert. I was surprised at how many
      parents, children, and self were putting themselves into danger in the
      current society today. Everyone is just bent on criticizing those who are
      vaping, using drug, when they themselves are sucked up in the world of
      Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and so on.<br /><br />I had always thought
      that the users, us, were the customers, and that the platform were just
      there to serve us. Then sometimes, the ads, or the ad sense would bring
      them, “the company” some coins and pennies. But no. The customers were the
      advertisement companies, and we were the displayed products. And we didn’t
      even know it.<br /><br />There needs to be a sense of awareness in the
      public. But, just like the person in Google, hoped to create a “boom”
      inside the company, it’s never going to happen overnight. Actually, people
      may already be gobbled up by the fact that they are now owned by the
      technology. First, education needs to change. It must happen within
      school, but also in family. Kids spend 1/3 of their time at home, if not
      sleeping or at school. Parents need to provide such an environment where
      technology and screens is not overly used, but the children need not feel
      that the parents are caging themselves. I honestly do not think that there
      is a one right answer to parenting and taking a hold of the time spent on
      electronics. However, I think there needs to be an all-around change in
      the society itself and it needs to begin within the self. There is always
      a limit if an action is forced upon. If one actually realizes the dangers
      and the impacts technology has on oneself, one may be slightly more alert
      to the feeds that he takes in, the videos that he watches, and the time he
      spends. I think it all begins with awareness and the video certainly
      brought that up amongst many.<br /><br />I think that the more value we
      take in the offline meetings, one-to-one conversations via calling or
      texting creates a better buildup of friendship and relationship. Posting
      one story on Instagram or one video on YouTube may grab attention and get
      a lot of likes, but there’s just not much point when you exit out of your
      screen. There needs to be a focus outside of all the newest updates on
      technology, who has the best gadgets, the highest level in a game, but on
      something that is more everlasting. I really think that when I meet
      someone, I will continue to express my thoughts on the negative and biting
      facts of SNS and continue to provide, not judge.<br /><br />There’s just
      one ultimate thing that lasts. God has been here before we were born and
      will be even after we die. Our assurance in God must be set before we look
      to take hold of other things and find peace and enjoyment that is so
      fulfilling and enchanting. In our walk with Christ, we must let down all
      the temptations and pray asking for more guidance and help. We cannot be
      the ones to destroy our greed and sin because we are so weak. We must hold
      onto God as our Savior and only hope as we crawl out of the sinking hole,
      we find ourselves in whether that be a social platform, hobby, or even our
      thoughts. I wish that I can truly live my life with the words, “God, lead
      me in your righteous path” coming out of my mouth.
